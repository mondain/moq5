/*
 * MPEG-2 Transport Stream packaging helpers for the MSF "mpeg2ts" packaging
 * (draft-gregoire-moq-msfts, MSFTS format version 3).
 *
 * An mpeg2ts track carries whole TS source packets: 188-octet TS packets, or
 * 192-octet M2TS source packets (a four-octet prefix followed by a TS
 * packet). This library checks Object payloads against the packaging rules,
 * inspects the TS syntax that the packaging relies on (PAT, PMT, CAT, PCR,
 * PES timestamps, random access points), and gives a publisher and a
 * subscriber building blocks for what the draft asks of them. Obligations
 * that need knowledge of the whole application (which tracks to subscribe
 * to, when to publish a new catalog, how to schedule egress) stay with the
 * application; the functions below say which part they cover.
 *
 * It is a demultiplexer-lite, not a decoder: it never looks inside an
 * elementary stream, never descrambles, and never allocates. Every field read
 * from a packet is bounds-checked; input is treated as adversarial. The only
 * shared data is a constant CRC table, so independent state structs may be
 * used from different threads at once.
 *
 * Borrowing: moq_bytes_t outputs point into the caller's input (or into the
 * caller's storage) and are valid while that buffer is, and for the section
 * reassembler only until its next call.
 *
 * Struct layouts:
 *   - Caller-owned state (section reassembler, receiver, program filter,
 *     switcher, packetizer) is initialised by *_init(p, sizeof *p, ...),
 *     which refuses a struct smaller than this build's. Its fields are
 *     private, and its size and layout are not frozen: they may grow before
 *     release, so allocate it with sizeof from the header it is used with
 *     rather than a fixed byte count. None of these structs points into
 *     itself, so a byte copy may be moved to another address and used there
 *     in place of the original.
 *     A copy is not an independent duplicate where the state refers to
 *     caller storage: the section reassembler's storage, the receiver's
 *     reorder slots and the packetizer's Object and lead-in buffers stay
 *     shared, so only one of the copies may go on being used.
 *   - Inputs with a leading struct_size (object rules, inspection config,
 *     and the receiver, filter and packetizer configs) are stamped by
 *     *_init_sized(p, size), or by the *_init(p) macro, which passes
 *     sizeof *p. The initializer clears and stamps min(size, this build's
 *     size), sets a default only on a field the prefix covers whole, and
 *     writes nothing when size cannot hold struct_size. A call refuses a
 *     struct_size below the size the struct had when first published
 *     (its *_V0_SIZE) and reads a field added later only when struct_size
 *     covers it.
 *   - Outputs with a leading struct_size (object report, object info,
 *     receive result, delivery, switcher and packetizer stats) are filled
 *     through (out, out_size): the call refuses an out_size below the
 *     output's *_V0_SIZE before it changes any state, writes
 *     min(out_size, this build's size) octets, and stamps struct_size with
 *     the octets written. A delivery's embedded receive result is stamped
 *     with its own full size.
 *   - Every other struct is a plain record with a frozen layout. A later
 *     revision adds a new struct and a new function rather than growing one
 *     of these.
 *
 * Link against moq::mpeg2ts (depends only on moq::core).
