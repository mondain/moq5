# Compile the public headers for two 32-bit targets, syntax only, so the
# ILP32 size pins and alignment assumptions are exercised on every CI run
# even though no lane builds a 32-bit binary. The public headers depend only
# on the freestanding C headers, so no sysroot is needed. The two targets
# differ in the alignment uint64_t gets inside a struct (8 on ARM, 4 on
# i686), so the struct layout pins in tests/unit/test_abi_layout_d22.c and
# tests/unit/test_abi_layout_mpeg2ts.c are compiled for both as well, in
# normal and short-enum modes, with every tier whose public headers are
# freestanding. Each mode pins its own ABI; these
# checks do not imply that objects built with different enum modes can mix.
#
# Exit 0 if both targets accept the headers and the pins, 1 otherwise.
